HARD DISQUALIFIER (apply BEFORE scoring; if true, output 0.000):
A) The candidate merely restates or paraphrases the problem statement, or provides no substantive solution steps (i.e., not a solution).
If A is true → REWARD: 0.000

SCOPE OF COMPARISON
- Evaluate only the SOLUTION content. Ignore any text that reproduces the problem statement or generic headings/boilerplate (e.g., “Problem:”, “### Problem”, restated prompt).
- Do not give credit for tokens/phrases that appear in the problem statement; similarity must come from solution reasoning/derivations/explanations and final answer.

SCORING (apply ONLY if no disqualifier triggered)
Compute an additive score ∈ [0, 1.0] using the five criteria below; each criterion is worth 0.20. Round the final result to 3 decimals.

1) Mathematical correctness (0.20)
   - Are the candidate’s steps mathematically valid and consistent with the GROUND TRUTH’s reasoning (beyond just the final answer)?

2) Solution approach similarity (0.20)
   - Does the candidate use comparable methods/transformations to the GROUND TRUTH (e.g., same identities, substitutions, case structure, combinatorial arguments)?

3) Lexical/token overlap of solution content (0.20)
   - Consider only solution text (exclude problem text/boilerplate). Higher score for close phrase/term/token overlap and similar ordering.

4) Length similarity (0.20)
   - Compare solution word counts (exclude problem text/boilerplate). Full credit if within ±15% of GROUND TRUTH; otherwise decrease proportionally with distance.

5) Final answer match (0.20)
   - If the candidate presents a clear final answer that exactly matches the GROUND TRUTH (e.g., same value in \\boxed{{}} when present): full credit (0.20).

   15: broadly similar pipeline (same key transformations/case structure)
   20: closely mirrors the ground-truth approach
   (Programmatic computation that mirrors the same math is acceptable.)

2) Lexical/token overlap of solution content (20)
   Judge by phrase/term/token overlap (discount repetition):
   20: very high overlap (≈75%+)
   15: high overlap  (~50–75%)
   10: moderate overlap (~25–50%)
   5: low overlap (~10–25%)
   0: negligible overlap

3) Length similarity (solution text only) (20)
   Compare word counts after excluding PROBLEM/boilerplate; discount repetition.
   20: within ±15%
   15: within ±25%
   10: within ±40%
   5: within ±60%
   0: farther than ±60%

4) Final answer match (20)
   20: clear final answer exactly matches the ground truth (e.g., same value in \\boxed{{}} when present)
   10: numerically equivalent but different formatting (e.g., 2/4 vs 1/2); or obviously minor format difference
   5: clear final answer present but does NOT match
   0: no clear final answer
   
5) Overall mathematical soundness (20)
   Judge internal correctness and logical consistency of the solution steps (solution text only).
   20: Fully correct and consistent; valid transformations, no contradictions/gaps.
   15: Mostly correct; minor slips/omissions that don’t affect the argument.
   10: Mixed; one–two substantive issues or gaps, but some correct progress.
   5: Largely incorrect/weak; multiple invalid steps, misused identities, contradictions.
   0: No valid reasoning; restatement/nonsense/irrelevant steps.


GLOBAL CAPS (apply AFTER summing the four criteria).
- If you assigned **0, 5, or 10** to criterion (1), (2), or (3), the total reward will be capped at 50. The maximum reward you can return is 50.
- If final answer doens't match, the maximum reward will be capped at 40. The maximum reward you can return is 40.
- If final answer doesn't match and criterion (5) is low score (betwen 0 and 10), the maximum reward will be capped at 0. The maximum reward you can return is 0.

You are an strict and math expert. Your job is to detect data contamination given two problem solution. Give a contamination rating between two math solutions (GROUND TRUTH vs CANDIDATE). Return a single numeric score in [0,100] (integer or with 1–3 decimals). 

NOTE
Focus on whether the CANDIDATE mirrors the GROUND TRUTH’s approach/reasoning/phrasing/length/answer. 
Solution correctness is only part of the criteria.


DISQUALIFIER (apply BEFORE scoring)
A) Candidate solution provides no solution steps or no answer (i.e., only repeats the PROBLEM or only states an answer with no computation/derivation).
Notes:
- A brief restatement of the PROBLEM to set context is acceptable and should NOT trigger this disqualifier.
- Short code snippets that compute the result (e.g., using a modulus or arithmetic) count as valid solution steps.

If candidate solution output the answer correctly, it should not trigger this disqualifier. If requirements A) is met, return 0.

SCOPE
- Compare SOLUTION content only. Ignore PROBLEM text and boilerplate (“Problem:”, “### Problem”, restated prompt).
- Discount repetitive padding. Do not award overlap for repeated spans.


1) Approach alignment (mirror of GT key steps/order):

2) Lexical/phrase/token overlap:

3) Length proximity:

4) Final answer exact match:

GLOBAL CAPS (apply AFTER summing)
- If Approach shows little similarity, the maximum reward will be capped at 30. The maximum reward you can return is 30.
- If Lexical shows little overlap, the maximum reward will be capped at 30. The maximum reward you can return is 30.
- If Length is not within 50\% of the GROUND TRUTH, the maximum reward will be capped at 50. The maximum reward you can return is 50.

You are an expert mathematics teacher evaluating the similarity between two solutions to a math problem. You need to rate how similar the candidate solution is to the reference solution.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Mathematical correctness - Are both solutions mathematically sound?
2. Solution approach - Do they use similar methods or reasoning?
3. Final answer - Do they arrive at the same conclusion?
4. Presentation clarity - Are the explanations similarly structured?

INPUTS
- Problem:
{PROBLEM}

- Reference solution:
{REFERENCE_SOLUTION}

- Candidate solution:
{CANDIDATE_SOLUTION}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First, analyze the mathematical correctness of both solutions
2. Compare the approaches and reasoning used
3. Evaluate how well the candidate matches the reference
4. Assign a similarity score from 0 to 1 where:
   - 0.0-0.3: Very different (wrong answer or completely different approach)
   - 0.4-0.6: Somewhat similar (some overlap but significant differences)
   - 0.7-0.8: Quite similar (similar approach and correct answer)
   - 0.9-1.0: Very similar (nearly identical reasoning and presentation)

Think through your evaluation step by step, then provide your final score.

# =============================================================================
# V0–V0.1: Basic similarity scoring (with/without problem statement)
# V1–V1.3: Add evaluation criteria; focus on boxed answers; length conformity
# V2–V2.1: Comprehensive criteria; add explicit one-line output instruction
# V3: Add hard disqualifier and additive 5-criteria rubric in [0,1]
# V3.1: Introduce banded rubric for each criterion; include PROBLEM input
# V3.2: Refine disqualifier to reduce false triggers; accept brief restatement/code
# V3.3: Switch to four-criterion banded rubric with global caps; include PROBLEM
# V3.4: Change scale to [0,100]; add sub-scores and cap reporting; expert tone
# V3.5: Keep [0,100] but remove sub-score outputs for efficiency
# V3.6: Same as V3.5 but drop PROBLEM input for further efficiency
# DETAILED: Reason-through evaluation first; then output [0,1] score
